# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions from humans and AI assistants.

## Getting Started

1. Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for repository conventions.
2. Work directly off the `main` branchâ€”do not create new branches.
3. Use functional, type-safe React components and keep the UI mobile responsive.

## Development Workflow

Before committing, run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

Include or update tests when adding new hooks or utilities.

## Resources

- [`structure.md`](structure.md) describes the codebase layout.
- [`docs/blueprint.md`](docs/blueprint.md) covers high-level features.

Sharing these files with an AI assistant gives it the context needed to contribute effectively.

- Work items live in `todo.yaml`. If you add new work during a PR, append a task with priority and acceptance criteria.
