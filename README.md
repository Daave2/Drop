# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file using `.env.example` as a template and provide your Firebase configuration values. Keep this file private and do not commit it to version control. If any key becomes exposed, regenerate it in the Google Cloud Console and update the file.
